<h2>  
    ABOUT ME 
</h2>
<p> 
    I currently go to
    <a href="https:/www.siths.org"> 
        SITHS.
    </a> 
    I am a sophomore right now, as of 2025.
    I like to think I am pretty good at STEM, though I am also very egotistical and competitive.
    Typically I have habits of writing a lot, as I am a very verbose person. I also love wasting my time.
    I spend my free time "on the grind," working until the job is done. I use a lot of my effort,
    though I don't like when people do not use their own effort (ex. asking dumb questions). 
</p>

<h3> 
    HOW I SPEND MY FREE TIME (in order of time taken) 
</h3>
<ol>
    <li> 
        hopelessly doomscrolling 
    </li>
    <li> 
        playing 
        <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com"> Pokemon Showdown! </a> 
    </li>
    <li> 
        doodling 
    </li>
</ol>

<h3> 
    BIOMETRICS 
</h3>
<ul>
    <li> 
        5'5.5" (I'm short so I round it up to 5'6)

        Averages 6.5 hours of sleep a day 
    </li>
    <li> 
        Averages 3 Coke Zeros a day 
    </li>
    <li> 
        Selective memory (can remember hundreds of digits of pi but not why I walked into a room) 
    </li>
    <li> 
        I have twisted my own ankle upwards of twenty times 
    </li>
    <li> 
        I have a brain strong enough to prevent myself from eating. And sleeping. And drinking water, but that is rarely. 
    </li>
</ul>
